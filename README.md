RunDynamoScript - Revit Add-in for Automating Dynamo Script Execution
📌 Description
RunDynamoScript is a Revit add-in designed to automate the execution of a predefined Dynamo script. This tool allows users to run Dynamo scripts directly from Revit with a single button click, eliminating the need to manually open Dynamo.

The add-in is structured to:

Execute a specified Dynamo (.dyn) script automatically without requiring manual input.
Run in automation mode, ensuring efficient and consistent execution.
Provide a Revit Ribbon button for easy access to the script execution.
This add-in is particularly useful for Revit users who need to streamline repetitive Dynamo workflows, improving efficiency and accuracy.

🚀 Features
✔ Automated Execution: Runs a Dynamo script seamlessly in the background.
✔ No UI Interruptions: Ensures a smooth Revit workflow by suppressing Dynamo’s interface.
✔ Integrated in Revit Ribbon: Adds a dedicated button in the Revit UI for quick execution.
✔ Supports Large-Scale Projects: Ideal for automating complex workflows.

🔧 How It Works
1️⃣ Ribbon Integration: A new tab and button are added to the Revit ribbon for easy access.
2️⃣ Dynamo Script Execution: When the button is clicked, the add-in triggers the predefined Dynamo script.
3️⃣ Automation Mode: The script executes in the background without requiring user input.
4️⃣ Results in Revit: The script processes data and applies results directly in the Revit model.

🛠 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Download and extract the latest release from GitHub Releases.
2️⃣ Copy the required files (.dll and .addin) into:

shell
Kopier
Rediger
%APPDATA%\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2024
3️⃣ Restart Revit and use the Run Dynamo Script button in the ribbon.

🎯 Use Case Example
Scenario:

A Revit user needs to automate a repetitive Dynamo script.
Instead of manually opening Dynamo, loading the script, and running it, they click one button in the Revit ribbon.
The script executes automatically and applies the results directly in Revit, saving time and reducing errors.
